# Design System

This project uses [styled-system](https://styled-system.com/) by Brent Jackson. The implementation
is similar to that of [rebass](https://rebassjs.org/getting-started) (also by Brent Jackson) but
with better configuration and typescript support.

> Styled System lets you quickly build custom UI components with constraint-based style props based on your own design system tokens.

```jsx
<Box
  fontSize={4}
  fontWeight="bold"
  p={3}
  mb={[4, 5]}
  color="white"
  bg="primary">
  Hello
</Box>
```
